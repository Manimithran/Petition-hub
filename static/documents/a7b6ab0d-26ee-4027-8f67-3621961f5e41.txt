Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to bring to your notice a critical case of environmental pollution in Perungudi, Chennai. The contamination of air, water, and soil due to the illegal dumping of industrial waste and sewage discharge is causing severe harm to both the ecosystem and public health.

This pollution has resulted in serious consequences, including respiratory illnesses among residents, groundwater contamination, and loss of biodiversity in the nearby lake. Given the urgent nature of this issue, I kindly request the authorities to:

Conduct an environmental inspection in the affected region.
Collect evidence of pollution and its sources.
Take strict legal action against those responsible.
We seek immediate intervention to prevent further ecological harm and protect the well-being of the residents. Kindly consider this matter as a priority and take the necessary steps to ensure environmental justice.

Thanking you.

Yours sincerely,
Vikash
